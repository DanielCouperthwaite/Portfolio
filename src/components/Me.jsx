                        For the last five years, I have been teaching English as a second language to students in 
                        Europe, Asia and South America. I worked in Vietnamese public schools in Gò Vấp, Japanese universities around Tokyo, and online from just about everywhere else! The youngest students I taught were just 3 years old, and the oldest was 79! 
                        (He was frustrated his grandchildren could communicate in English without him knowing!) 
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8"> 
                        Now, back in the UK, I have been learning to code since 
                        the start of this year as a way to bring about some stability to my life. I love the problem-solving aspects, and the ability to collaborate
                        with others to build something much larger than I could have done alone.
                    </p>

                        In my free time you can find me either on top of a mountain in the Lake or Peak district. I have been playing guitar since I was a teenager and also love trying out new recipes. (I am so proud of 
                        my garlic naans I very nearly listed them as a project below!)
