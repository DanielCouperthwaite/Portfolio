                        My name is Daniel, an English teacher turned full stack developer.

                        The youngest students I taught were just 3 years old, and the oldest was 79! ( He was frustrated his grandchildren could communicate in English without him knowing! )

                        I am growing my development skills every day and would love the chance to do this in a team as a junior developer. You can see some of the projects I have made below, or follow updates from my <a href={"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-couperthwaite-209290139/"} target="_blank">linkedIn</a> account.

                        In my free time you can find me either on top of a mountain in the Lake or Peak district. I have been playing guitar since I was a teenager and also love trying out new recipes. (I am so proud of my homemade naan breads I even listed them as a bonus project below!)
                    </p>

                        Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions about myself, my projects or you have recipes to recommend.
